###### 5-23-17 Assignment 1 and first try with the LDR

Problems Encountered:

When trying to use the LDR with the LED, various codes and configurations never seemed to work. My goal was to have the LED turn on when its dark and turn off in the presence of light. Despite my many tries, nothing seemed to work even when I copied other codes and variations from online tutorials exactly.

###### 5-25-17 LED Reacting to light with and LDR

Problems encountered:

The first task, the AnalogInput, did not seem to work for me. It never showed anything on the serial monitor and didn't react to the amount of light on the LDR.
The second set of tasks weren't as successful. The power showed on the Serial Monitor but didnt react to the change of light. I'm sure it is my code at fault but I am not sure how to fix it.
**Update:** Successfully got the PrintIn to work, the LDR ranges from 690 to 920 in changing light and got the LED to properly react to the change in light.
