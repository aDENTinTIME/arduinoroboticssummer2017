5-23-17 Problems Encountered:

When trying to use the LDR with the LED, various codes and configurations never seemed to work. My goal was to have the LED turn on when its dark and turn off in the presence of light. Despite my many tries, nothing seemed to work even when I copied other codes and variations from online tutorials exactly. This made me wonder wether it was my equipment at fault rather than the codes so I plan to try this again with a new LDR.

The first task, the AnalogInput, did not seem to work for me. It never showed anything on the serial monitor and didn't react to the amount of light on the LDR.
The second set of tasks weren't as successful. The power showed on the Serial Monitor but didnt react to the change of light. I'm sure it is my code at fault but I am not sure how to fix it.
